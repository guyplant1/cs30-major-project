# Project Description

A mainly 2D story game where you interact with an opponent/opponents (like a mario level for example, with minions and or a boss battle), like games where you try to keep your HP above 0 as the player, and winning the battle that you have with the opponent(s).

## Needs to have

- The player has a way to attack opponents, like by using projectiles that collide into opponents for example. Attacks would also cause opponents to disappear after losing from the player.
- At least 1 complete playable level.
- WASD is used, where the keys can be held down and control a player's movement, instead of constant pressing of the keys to move.
- The player has different ways of interacting or colliding with other characters (as in opponenets and or shapes) in some kind of way, like by a jump or collision function for example. This would also include player attacks.
- Basic opponent behaviour and or attacks (just structered by myself in the code, like simple opponent movements that continue to loop).
- Make each level have more than a boss battle, like progressing past minions in the start of the level, before going to the boss at the near end of the level.
- Uses shapes with different colors and or textures to represent different materials, objects, and or characters in the game scene.
- There is at least a start menu screen and a game over screen.
- Some kind of story or storyline shown in the game.
- Cutscenes are used for the story of the game, being done in 3D, and displayed as a video in the code.
- Uses sound effects and or background music.

## Nice to have

- A tutorial level/screen.
- The player can achieve checkpoints to save their progress in a level or levels.
- Different main levels to choose from, or to progress through (adds to the game's story or storyline as well).
- Achievements and or shop system, like being able to gain achievements by doing certain tasks in the game, and or collecting a currency that can be used to purchase things, for example, skins for the player and or characters in the game, different attacks for the player, and etc.
- Advanced opponent behaviour (possible use of AI, opponents can find the player using some kind of pathfinding, and or unique or more randomly set of attacks. This could be for both minion and boss opponents).
