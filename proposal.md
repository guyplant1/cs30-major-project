# Project Description

A 3D story game where you interact with an opponent (like a boss battle), like games where you try to keep your HP above 0 as the player, and winning the battle that you have with the opponent.

## Needs to have

- The display of my project is in 3D.
- WASD is used, where the keys can be held down and control a player's movement, instead of constant pressing of the keys to move.
- The player is able to interact or collide with other characters (as in opponenets and or shapes).
- Basic jump for the player (not using physics, probably just changing the player's y state for a second or two).
- Basic opponent behaviour and or attacks (just structered by myself in the code, like simple opponent movements that continue to loop).
- The game scene is made with an array or arrays, using shapes with different colors or textures to represent different materials and or objects.
- There is at least a start menu screen and a game over screen.
- Some kind of story or storyline shown in the game.
- A 3rd person camera view is accomplished in the gameplay.
- Uses sound effects and or background music.

## Nice to have

- A tutorial level/screen.
- Make each level have more than a boss battle, like progressing past minions in the start of the level, before going to the boss at the near end of the level.
- Advanced opponent behaviour (possible use of AI, opponents can find the player using some kind of pathfinding, and or unique or more randomly set of attacks. This could be for both minion and boss opponents).
- Different main levels to choose from, or to progress through (adds to the game's story or storyline as well).
- The player can achieve checkpoints to save their progress in a level.
- Player is able to jump with physics.
- Player is able to switch from 1st to 3rd person camera views in the game.
- Different types of attacks for the player, besides from dodging, jumping and colliding into/onto opponents.
