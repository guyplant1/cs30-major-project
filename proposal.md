# Project Description

A 3D game where you interact with an opponent (like a boss battle), like trying to keep your HP above 0 as the player, and winning the battle with the opponent.

## Needs to have

- The display of my project will be in 3D.
- WASD is used, in that, the keys can be held down and control a player's movement, instead of constant pressing the keys to move.
- The player is able to interact with other characters (as in opponenets or shapes).
- thing 2

## Nice to have

- Different levels/ opponents
- another thing
