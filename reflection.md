# Reflection
## Advice for myself
- I feel that I would put in more time in my project to have it be more successful.
- Being more descernful of how far to go for coding and ideas to implement in the project.
- Maybe ask others on what they've experienced in doing projects like this, or people in the same process that I was in for coding a project like this.

## Needs to have list
I feel that my final result brings the outcome of the majority of my listed needs in my needs to have list, but not all.

## The hardest part of the project
The implementation of loading and saving JSON files that were to represent drawn rooms was the hardest part to make in my project. I feel it took the most time to figure out in logic, but I feel I learned more about coding in kind of taking a risk in coding this type of idea.

## Unsolved problems
I feel that I've mostly found unsolved problems in how my project is displayed on different devices, which changes how my JSON files look compared to my laptop/computer at home. I also found that in ending this project that my second cutscene doesn't play, which worked at home, but the first cutscene has seemed to work on both devices at school and home.
